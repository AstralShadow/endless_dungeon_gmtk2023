All formats start with u32 describing their version.
This way i can have lodaing logic for all versions.

Common functions implement storage of basic data types:
    string, u8, u16, u32, u64
Integer types are written in Big Endian format.
Strings store their length as u32 before their content.

Floats have multiple storage options:
    mapf and unmapf, which are untested and may not work
    raw storage (writef, readf), which is system specific
    substract, multiply and cast to int
