# General concept points

## Definitions:
- Player - the person playing the game
- Hero - the main character of the game

## Base info:
- Initial Genre: Rogue-like


## Description
The player gets to design the game levels & difficulty.

Every level starts with a dungeon that's not connected.

In every area there're a bunch of enemies and bonuses.
In the first area (centered on screen) there's just the hero.

The Player plays in level-edit mode and connect/disconnect the different dungeon rooms as they see fit.

The Hero explores new zones, prefers treasure and attacks or runs away from enemies.

Fights with enemies grant different skill (XP) bonuses.

Treasures grant him items or buffs.
Treasure chests let the Player pick the item.


# Gameplay

The Player has to balance between challenging and rewarding the Hero.


## Stats of the Hero

- Health
    When low makes the Hero try to stay out of danger.
- Stamina
    Determines possible actions
    Recharging stamina consumes Resources
- Damage
- Defense
- Speed


- Resources (Food/Water)
    The Hero would need to finish a level if low on resources.
    When resources are too low hero loses morale, health and battle stats.
- Morale
    Directly affects if the Hero's willing to attack stronger enemies or not.
- Wealth
    Too low makes the Hero reckless
    Too high takes away motivation from the Hero


## Hero behavior
The hero can act in one of these manners:

- Stealthy 
    The Hero is trying to stay away from enemies or ambush them.
    Does not engage in fights with multiple enemies

- Brave
    Will attack multiple enemies if he thinks he can defeat them.
    Will seek the unknown

- Desperate (debuff)
    Will not make risk calculations properly.
- Unmotivated (debuff)
    Will only aim to exit the dungeon instead exploring.
    Exiting as unmotivated leads to an ending.
- Well Rested (buff)
    Bonus to damage, speed and defense.
